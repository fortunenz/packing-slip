# Packing Slip Generator

## About
This application was created for the purpose of creating professional looking
packing slips for the company, Fortune Enterprises. It allows the user to focus
on what the customer needs instead of needing to remember how the item is packaged
reducing mistakes and improving the companies overall professional image.

This application has since been updated to support invoice slips, another critical
part of the workflow of orders processed at Fortune Enterprises and will now
allow all orders processed through Fortune Enterprises to no longer require
hand written slips.

## Running the application

Stable versions can be found at fortunenz.github.io/packing-slip or you can
download the repository and run index.html in your preferred browser.
